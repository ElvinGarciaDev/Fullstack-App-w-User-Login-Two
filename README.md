## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS, Bootstrap

Fullstack application where users can log in, search for a movie and bookmark it. Once a movie is bookmarked it's saved to your profile. Only movies the logged-in user has bookmarked will show on the profile. Once a movie has been bookmarked, the user has the option of clicking the check icon to mark it as completed, or can click the trash icon to delete a movie. The logged-in user has access to only delete the movies on their profile. This prevents any users from removing any similar movies other users might have bookmarked.
